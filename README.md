# Test SMAPI Java
This project is being developed to test [Login with Amazon](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/login-with-amazon/install-sdk-javascript.html) and the [Alexa Skill Management API (SMAPI)](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/smapi/smapi-overview.html) using the [GWT SDK](http://www.gwtproject.org/download.html).

## Build from the command line with Ant
(Generated by [GWT WebAppCreator](http://www.gwtproject.org/doc/latest/tutorial/index.html))

If you prefer to work from the command line, you can [use Ant to build your
project](http://ant.apache.org/).  Ant uses the generated `build.xml` file
which describes exactly how to build your project.  This file has been tested
to work against Ant 1.7.1.

Before you build your project, make sure to change the `gwt.sdk` path in the build file, which looks something like this:
`<property name="gwt.sdk" location="/path/to/sdk/folder" />`. (Change the `location` field to be the path containing your [GWT SDK, which can be downloaded here](http://www.gwtproject.org/download.html).)

The following assumes `ant` is on your command
line path.

To run development mode, just type `ant devmode`.

To compile your project for deployment, just type `ant`.

To compile and also bundle into a .war file, type `ant war`.

If you supplied the junit path when invoking webAppCreator, you can type `ant test` to run tests in development and production mode.
 
For a full listing of other targets, type `ant -p`.
