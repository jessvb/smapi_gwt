# Test SMAPI Java
This project is being developed to test [Login with Amazon](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/login-with-amazon/install-sdk-javascript.html) and the [Alexa Skill Management API (SMAPI)](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/smapi/smapi-overview.html) using the [GWT SDK](http://www.gwtproject.org/download.html).

## Setup
Before you build your project, change the `build.xml.template` filename to `build.xml`. Within this file, change the `gwt.sdk` path in the build file (which looks something like this:
`<property name="gwt.sdk" location="/path/to/gwt/sdk/folder" />`) to contain the path of your GWT SDK.  (The [GWT SDK can be downloaded here](http://www.gwtproject.org/download.html).)

You will also need to obtain an Amazon Client ID, which can be [set up on the Amazon Seller Central website](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/hz/home). Take note of your Amazon Client ID number, and add this number to the `AmazonClientId.java.template` file where it says "return "string_of_client_id_from_https://sellercentral.amazon.com/hz/home"". Finally, rename `AmazonClientId.java.template` to `AmazonClientId.java`.

## Build from the command line with Ant
(Generated by [GWT WebAppCreator](http://www.gwtproject.org/doc/latest/tutorial/index.html))

If you prefer to work from the command line, you can [use Ant to build your
project](http://ant.apache.org/).  Ant uses the generated `build.xml` file
which describes exactly how to build your project.  This file has been tested
to work against Ant 1.7.1.

The following assumes `ant` is on your command
line path.

To run development mode, just type `ant devmode`.

To compile your project for deployment, just type `ant`.

To compile and also bundle into a .war file, type `ant war`.

If you supplied the junit path when invoking webAppCreator, you can type `ant test` to run tests in development and production mode.
 
For a full listing of other targets, type `ant -p`.
